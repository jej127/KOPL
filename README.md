# KOPS
This is a Pytorch implementation of KOPS.

## Getting Background Model
You first need to download SISG(jm) background word embeddings which you can get [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10duKoWlUGyhyWvWQWIizbcfLFCxJ0zjD/view?usp=sharing).

## Prepare IPA data
The next step is to construct the IPA sequence for each word in the vocabulary of SISG(jm).

Run the following codes to do this.
```
# Arrange words in a text file
python extract_vocab.py

# Construct IPA sequences
python ./ipa_convert/create_ipa.py
```
